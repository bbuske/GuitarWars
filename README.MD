# Guitar Wars HTML / PHP / mySQL Web App # 

This is a web app, allowing users to upload scores of the fictional GuitarHero game. While this web app has no purpose, 
other than to upload a fictional score, with an image, proving the score is valid, it does show how HTML, PHP and mySQL 
can work together, in order to create a pretty sophisticated WebApp.
